        <div className="blog-content">
          <p className="blog-intro">
            As a web development student, I wanted to tackle a project that would test my front-end skills and mimic a real-world application. I decided to build a mock e-commerce site for a jewelry brand called "Verika" and coffee shop brand called "Cozy Beans".
          </p>
          <p>
            While this project gives the illusion of a complete online store, it's important to note that it's a <strong>front-end-only application</strong>. This means I focused entirely on the user interface and functionality visible to the user, without a back-end server to manage a database or process payments. This was a crucial learning experience that taught me just how much complexity lies on the client side of the web.
          </p>

          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            My goal was to create a clean, elegant, and fully responsive e-commerce front end. The app needed to have a home page, a product gallery with multiple items, a dedicated page for each individual product, a functioning shopping cart, and a smooth, intuitive user experience.
          </p>

          <h2>My Technology Stack</h2>
          <p>
            I chose to build the application with a few core front-end technologies:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>React:</strong> I used React for its component-based structure, which was perfect for breaking down the complex UI into reusable pieces.</li>
            <li><strong>React Router:</strong> Essential for navigation between pages and creating dynamic routes for each product.</li>
            <li><strong>React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`):</strong> My go-to tools for managing all the data in my application, from the shopping cart to fetching simulated product data.</li>
            <li><strong>CSS:</strong> I focused on writing clean CSS using <strong>Flexbox</strong> and <strong>CSS Grid</strong> to create a responsive layout.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Biggest Challenges </h2>
          <h3>Verika Jewelry Store</h3>
          <p>
            Even without a back end, this project presented some serious challenges:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Managing the Shopping Cart:</strong> Without a server, I had to manage all cart data in React's state, learning how to pass data between different components.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Routing:</strong> Setting up a unique page for each product was tricky. I had to learn how to use route parameters (`/products/:productId`) to find and display the correct product details.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Cozy Beans Coffee Shop</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Making the website responsive on all devices.</li>
            <li>Integrating interactive sliders using Swiper.js.</li>
            <li>Validating and handling user inputs in the contact form.</li>
            <li>Maintaining consistent coffee-themed design and styling.</li>
            <li>Creating easy-to-use navigation for a smooth user experience.</li>
            <li>Optimizing images for fast loading without quality loss.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>What I Learned from the Experience</h2>
          <p>
            Building the Verika Jewelry Store front end was an incredibly valuable experience. I learned that even a front-end-only application can be complex and challenging. Here are my biggest takeaways:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Front-end can be "full-stack" within itself.</strong> The concepts of data flow, state management, and routing are just as important on the client side as they are on the server side.</li>
            <li><strong>Components are a game-changer.</strong> Breaking down the UI into small, reusable pieces made the project feel manageable, even as it grew.</li>
            <li><strong>The user's experience is paramount.</strong> The core of this project was creating a smooth, beautiful interface, and I now have a much deeper appreciation for responsive design and intuitive navigation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Building Cozy Beans Shop helped me learn how to create a responsive and visually consistent website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap</p>
          <p>While incorporating interactive features with JavaScript and Swiper.js. You gained practical experience in validating user inputs through forms, optimizing images for better performance, and designing an intuitive navigation structure to enhance user experience. Overall, the project helped develop your skills in integrating multiple web technologies to build a functional and engaging online platform.</p>
